# Used Car Price Intelligence: AI-Enhanced Valuation 🚗📊

## Project Overview
This project develops a robust predictive engine to estimate the market value of used cars. By leveraging **Multivariate Regression** techniques and **Polynomial Feature Mapping**, the model identifies non-linear relationships between a vehicle's age, mileage, engine size, and fuel efficiency to provide accurate pricing insights.

This repository demonstrates a modern **AI-assisted Data Science workflow**, utilizing Generative AI for code optimization, logic validation, and rapid prototyping of complex visualization pipelines.

##  Technical Workflow
A hybrid approach was used to ensure both statistical rigor and development efficiency:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed deep-dive analysis to identify skews in fuel types and handle missing tax data via median imputation.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Applied `PolynomialFeatures` (Degree 2) to capture hidden interactions between variables that a standard linear model would miss.
3. **Regularization & Optimization:** Implemented **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)** to handle multi-collinearity. Used `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal alpha ($\alpha=10$).
4. **AI-Assisted Development:** Leveraged GenAI to streamline the creation of modular preprocessing pipelines and validate statistical assumptions during model selection.

## 📈 Model Performance & Results
The final Ridge Regression model significantly outperformed simple linear benchmarks by capturing combined feature effects.

| Metric | Multi-Variable Ridge Model |
| :--- | :--- |
| **R² Score** | **0.7080** |
| **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) | **£1,754.02** |
| **RMSE** (Root Mean Sq. Error) | **2,558.99** |

##  Future Enhancements
To further improve the model's predictive power and utility, the following steps are planned:

* **Advanced Algorithms:** Transition from Linear/Ridge regression to Ensemble methods like **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** to capture complex non-linear patterns.
* **Feature Enrichment:** Incorporate vehicle 'Brand' and 'Model' categories using Target Encoding to account for luxury vs. economy price premiums.
* **Log Transformation:** Apply Logarithmic transformations to the target variable (`price`) to better handle the skewed distribution of high-end vehicle prices.
* **Deployment:** Develop a lightweight **Streamlit web application** to allow users to input car details and receive real-time price estimates.
* **Automated Pipeline:** Implement a Scikit-Learn `ColumnTransformer` pipeline for more efficient handling of categorical and numerical features in a single flow.

### Key Insights:
* **Non-Linearity:** Used car prices do not depreciate linearly; polynomial mapping was essential to improve accuracy from an initial R² of ~0.34 to **0.71**.
* **Generalization:** The model achieved a CV R² of **0.74** during grid search, indicating strong performance on unseen market data.
* **Feature Importance:** Vehicle 'Year' and 'Engine Size' were identified as the primary drivers of valuation.
