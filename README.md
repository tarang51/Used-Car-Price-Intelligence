Used Car Price Intelligence: AI-Enhanced Valuation 🚗📊Project OverviewThis project develops a robust predictive engine to estimate the market value of used cars. By leveraging Multivariate Regression techniques and Polynomial Feature Mapping, the model identifies non-linear relationships between a vehicle's age, mileage, engine size, and fuel efficiency to provide accurate pricing insights.This repository demonstrates a modern AI-assisted Data Science workflow, utilizing Generative AI for code optimization, logic validation, and rapid prototyping of complex visualization pipelines.🧠 Technical WorkflowA hybrid approach was used to ensure both statistical rigor and development efficiency:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed deep-dive analysis to identify skews in fuel types and handle missing tax data via median imputation.Feature Engineering: Applied PolynomialFeatures (Degree 2) to capture hidden interactions between variables that a standard linear model would miss.Regularization & Optimization: Implemented Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) to handle multi-collinearity. Used GridSearchCV to find the optimal alpha ($\alpha=10$).AI-Assisted Development: Leveraged GenAI to streamline the creation of modular preprocessing pipelines and validate statistical assumptions during model selection.📈 Model Performance & ResultsThe final Ridge Regression model significantly outperformed simple linear benchmarks by capturing combined feature effects.MetricMulti-Variable Ridge ModelR² Score0.7080MAE (Mean Absolute Error)£1,754.02RMSE (Root Mean Sq. Error)2,558.99Key Insights:Non-Linearity: Used car prices do not depreciate linearly; polynomial mapping was essential to improve accuracy from an initial R² of ~0.34 to 0.71.Generalization: The model achieved a CV R² of 0.74 during grid search, indicating strong performance on unseen market data.Feature Importance: Vehicle 'Year' and 'Engine Size' were identified as the primary drivers of valuation.🛠️ Tech StackProgramming: PythonLibraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SeabornEnvironment: Jupyter Notebook / Google ColabMethodologies: L2 Regularization, Polynomial Transformation, Hyperparameter Tuning, AI-Augmented Programming📂 Repository StructureUsed Car Price Intelligence.ipynb: Full analytical pipeline including data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.README.md: Project documentation and performance summary.
